This application is a Java library for Ogame elements. The goal is to implement all the needed elements programers can use to implement an Ogame-related Java application. If someone want to use it, feel free to do so (BSD license => do what you want with it, this is not my problem). Of course, if you need something, feel free to open an issue to ask for it. If it is strictly related to Ogame, it will be probably implemented. Any feedback is also welcome (fixes, optimizations, ...).
